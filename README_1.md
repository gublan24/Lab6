# Lab6

I do not import Lab6 DatabaseProject into Android Studio, instead of importing I :
1. Create a new empty project.
2. Copy the following files from DatabaseProject into /res/layout:
  a. activity_main.xml
  b. activity_about.xml
3. Copy the following files into /app/java :
  a. About.java
  b. MainActivity.java
  c. Product.java
4. Copy the following files into /res/values :
  a. dimens.xml
5. Fix all errors in java files because of missing imports for some classes.
6. Its ready to continue doing the tasks.
